# Anthro Zeds Extended
Anthro Zeds Extended (AZE) is a mod for Project Zomboid that allows zombies to spawn as anthro animals ("furries"). It provides a number of fixes and additions over the original mod, [Anthro Zeds](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2930890411), by Sai.

AZE does not include any models. It only provides the ability for zombies to spawn as species added by other mods, as well as an interface for tweaking said spawns.

## Installation
The by far easiest method is to simply subscribe to the mod on Steam Workshop. (Link will be added once uploaded.) Steam will download, unpack, and install everything in the proper place for you. It will also automatically download and install updates whenever I add them.

If for some reason you insist on installing it manually, Windows users can download this repo and place it in C:/users/<\username>/Zomboid/mods/AnthroZedsExtended.

## Additions
Anthro Zeds Extended adds a number of features not included in the original Anthro Zeds mod:

* The "hybrid glitch" where zeds would spawn multiple species, and thus have things like extra antlers or tails, has been fixed. This was the main reason I made this mod, tbh.
* An entirely new way of equipping zombies that doesn't remove underwear spawns. Because dead bodies having bras on was *very* important.
* Automatic detection of which submods are installed, preventing the need to have a different mod for every submod.
* Increased compatibility, allowing spawns of _all_ species that are available on Workshop, instead of just Anthro Survivors and Scalies.
* By default, increases spawns to 100% of all zombies. You can change this in Sandbox settings.
* Toggleable oddities, allowing you to disable things like fantasy species (ex. jackalopes, dragons), anachronisms (ex. protogens, synths), and unnatural colors (ex. blue cows, pink sheep). Just in case you want your 1993 themed bipedal dog zombie apocalypse to be realistic, you know?

## Coming Soon
Currently working on adding these things.

* Customizable spawn weights, so you can prioritize the species you want to see more of.

## Dependencies
* None

AZE *technically* does not require any other mods to run. However, running AZE on its own is pointless, as it has no models to add and thus does nothing. If you want to see AZE actually work and add anthro zombies, you must install at least one of the mods in the section below.

## Compatible Mods
The following mods are compatible with Anthro Zeds Extended, and will automatically add them to the spawn list:

* [Anthro Survivors](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2893930681) by Wuffwick and Jaql
* [Anthro Survivors - Ungulate Friends](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2934987146) by Yap
* [Anthro Survivors - Cobra and Jackalope](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3092480630) by CAESURA
* [Anthro Survivors - Loong](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3157929817) by CAESURA
* [Anthro Survivors - More Species](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2986277840) by Xochiesuincle

### Upcoming
I plan to add the following mods as compatible soon:

* [Anthro Survivors - Scalies!](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2921417999) by JusFoNo
* [Anthro Survivors - Aligator and Shark](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3069371309) by CAESURA
* [Anthro Survivors - Insectoids](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3162204987) by CAESURA

I am mostly trying to figure out how to approach Scalies, as it has an enormous amount of models so simply adding them all in is not an option as it would greatly outweigh all the other species.

## Incompatible Mods
The following mods are **not** compatible with Anthro Zeds Extended. Do not run these mods while Anthro Zeds Extended is running.

* [Anthro Zeds](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2930890411) by Sai
* [Scaly Zeds](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2923210340) by Sai
  * Both of these will spawn additional furry skins onto each zombie, giving a glitchy, clipping effect.
* Any mods that add face masks or cloaks may experience clipping with long snouts and tails. This is entirely cosmetic. It is up to the model creator to add compatibility with Anthro Survivors.

I am currently unaware of any other incompabilities. This should function fine with just about anything.

## Known Issues

I am aware of a few minor issues. They are all cosmetic and do not affect gameplay.

* Extremely rarely some zombies will just... not be furry. I have exhausted literally all reasons I and the modders I asked why this might be. Just going to have to live with 99.9% furs.
* Something causes zeds to rarely have transparent scalps. I have no idea what. I suspect it is a bandage or wound. Someone who knows 3D modeling will probably have to look at this.
* Already-dead zombies don't update in the same way "living" zombies do, and so don't have fur equipped, leaving them as humans. I have not yet added a mechanic to detect corpses and add something.s

## FAQ

### Can I have 100% anthro spawns?
Yes, as of the new version you should get rougly 100% anthro spawns. There are still a handful of circumstances where humans spawn, but these are bugs I am squishing (see known issues).

### Will this spawn specific skins from individual fursona workshop items?
No. AZE only spawns the skins included in the base mods listed above in _compatible mods._

There are dozens of them, and it would be an enormous time investment to include every single individual skin uploaded to Workshop. Additionally, most people want their characters to be the survivor, not the zombie, and would dislike seeing multiple of themselves.

### I saw something unique, does AZE have any textures in it?
There are a few very rare spawn (~1:100,000) easter egg zeds, yes. They are OCs of mine and my close friends.

### Can I play a human with anthro zombies?
AZE makes absolutely zero changes to players. You can play as anything you want, including humans.

### Can you add X or Y species?
No. My knowledge and skill with 3D modeling is extremely limited. If you would like a new species added, you will either have to learn to model and texture it yourself and then upload it to the Workshop for inclusion, or commission one of the people that do create new species to make yours.
