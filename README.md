# Anthro Zeds Extended
Anthro Zeds Extended (AZE) is a mod for Project Zomboid that allows zombies to spawn as anthro animals ("furries"). It provides a number of fixes and additions over the original mod, Anthro Zeds, by Sai.

AZE does not include any models. It only provides the ability for zombies to spawn as species added by other mods, as well as an interface for tweaking said spawns.

## Installation
The by far easiest method is to simply subscribe to the mod on Steam Workshop. Steam will download, unpack, and install everything in the proper place for you. It will also automatically download and install updates whenever I add them.

If for some reason you insist on installing it manually, Windows users can download this repo and place it in C:/users/<\username>/Zomboid/mods/AnthroZedsExtended.

## Additions
Anthro Zeds Extended adds a number of features not included in the original Anthro Zeds mod:

* The "hybrid glitch" where zeds would spawn multiple species, and thus have things like extra antlers or tails, has been fixed. This was the main reason I made this mod, tbh.
* Automatic detection of which submods are installed, preventing the need to have a different mod for every submod.
* Increased compatibility, allowing spawns of _all_ species that are available on Workshop, instead of just Anthro Survivors and Scalies.
* By default, increases spawns to 100% of all zombies. You can change this in Sandbox settings.
* Customizable spawn weights, so you can prioritize the species you want to see more of.
* Toggleable oddities, allowing you to disable things like fantasy species (ex. jackalopes, dragons), anachronisms (ex. protogens, synths), and unnatural colors (ex. blue cows, pink sheep).

## Dependencies
* None

AZE *technically* does not require any other mods to run. However, running AZE on its own is pointless, as it has no models to add and thus does nothing. If you want to see AZE actually work and add anthro zombies, you must install at least one of the mods in the section below.

## Compatible Mods
The following mods are compatible with Anthro Zeds Extended, and will automatically add them to the spawn list:

* [Anthro Survivors](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2893930681) by Wuffwick and Jaql
* [Anthro Survivors - Ungulate Friends](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2934987146) by Yap
* [Anthro Survivors - Cobra and Jackalope](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3092480630) by CAESURA
* [Anthro Survivors - Loong](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3157929817) by CAESURA

### Upcoming
I plan to add the following mods as compatible soon:

* [Anthro Survivors - More Species](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2986277840) by Xochiesuincle
* [Anthro Survivors - Scalies!](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2921417999) by JusFoNo
* [Anthro Survivors - Aligator and Shark](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3069371309) by CAESURA
* [Anthro Survivors - Insectoids](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3162204987) by CAESURA

## Incompatible Mods
The following mods are **not** compatible with Anthro Zeds Extended. Do not run these mods while Anthro Zeds Extended is running.

* [Anthro Zeds](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2930890411) by Sai
* [Scaly Zeds](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2923210340) by Sai
  * Both of these will at best duplicate some spawns, at worst completely override what this mod does. They do the same thing anyway, so there's no point.

I am currently unaware of any other incompabilities. This should function fine with just about anything. You may see snouts clipping on anything that adds masks.

## Known Issues

I am aware of a few minor issues, nothing that actually impacts gameplay.

* Something causes zeds to rarely have transparent scalps. I have no idea what.
* Already-dead zombies don't update in the same way "living" zombies do, and so don't have fur equipped, leaving them as humans.
* If no other options exist and a t-shirt is replaced, it may "pop-in" when the zombie dies.

## FAQ

### Can I have 100% anthro spawns?
Yes, as of the new version you should get 100% anthro spawns. The only exception is corpses (see known issues).

### Will this spawn specific skins from individual fursona workshop items?
No. AZE only spawns the skins included in the base mods listed above in _compatible mods._

There are simply too many of them to go through and add every single one to this, and then keeping it updated would be a large time investment. Additionally, most people want their characters to be the survivor, not the zombie, and would dislike seeing multiple of themselves.

### I saw something unique, does AZE have any textures in it?
There are a few very rare spawn (~1:100,000) easter egg zeds, yes. They are OCs of mine and my close friends.

### Can I play a human with anthro zombies?
AZE makes absolutely zero changes to players. You can play as anything you want, including humans.

### Can you add X or Y species?
No. My knowledge and skill with 3D modeling is extremely limited. If you would like a new species added, you will either have to learn to model and texture it yourself and then upload it to the Workshop for inclusion, or commission one of the people that do create new species to make yours.
