# AnthroZedsExtended
AnthroZedsExtended is a mod for Project Zomboid that allows zombies to spawn as anthro animals ("furries"). It provides a large number of fixes and additions over the original mod, AnthroZeds, by Sai.

AZE does not include any models. It only provides the ability for zombies to spawn as species added by other mods, as well as an interface for tweaking said spawns.

## Additions
AnthroZedsExtended adds a number of features over the original AnthroZeds mod:

* The "hybrid glitch" where zeds would spawn multiple species, and thus have things like extra antlers or tails, has been fixed. This was the main reason I made this mod, tbh.
* Automatic detection of which submods are installed, preventing the need to have a different mod for every submod.
* Increased compatibility, allowing spawns of _all_ species that are available on Workshop, instead of just Anthro Survivors and Scalies.
* Customizable spawn weights, so you can prioritize the species you want to see more of.
* Toggleable oddities, allowing you to disable things like fantasy species (ex. jackalopes, dragons), anachronisms (ex. protogens, synths), and unnatural colors (ex. blue cows, pink sheep).

## Dependencies
* Anthro Survivors

While AZE _technically_ does not need Anthro Survivors to function, it is pointless to run this mod without it as AZE will have nothing to add to the spawn tables.

## Compatible Mods
The following mods are compatible with AnthroZedsExtended, and will automatically add them to the spawn list:

* Anthro Survivors
* Anthro Survivors - Ungulate Friends
* Anthro Survivors - Cobra and Jackalope
* Anthro Survivors - Loong

### Upcoming
I plan to add the following mods as compatible soon:

* Anthro Survivors - More Species
* Anthro Survivors - Scalies!
* Anthro Survivors - Aligator and Shark
* Anthro Survivors - Insectoids

## FAQ

### Can I have 100% anthro spawns?
Currently not possible. The method AZE uses to spawn anthro zombies is an addition to the game's zombie underwear spawning system (yes, really). As a result, we can only ADD options. As it currently stands, the chance to spawn anthro:human is 10000:100, or 100 to 1, meaning out of every 100 zombies, one should be human. Just pretend it is a monkey furry or something.

I believe this can be fixed, but will take some work to do so.

### Will this spawn specific skins from individual fursona workshop items?
No. AZE only spawns the skins included in the base mods listed above in _compatible mods._

There are simply too many of them to go through and add every single one to this, and then keeping it updated would be a large time investment. Additionally, most people want their characters to be the survivor, not the zombie, and would dislike seeing multiple of themselves.

### I saw something unique, does AZE have any textures in it?
There are a few very rare spawn easter egg zeds, yes. They are mostly OCs of mine and my close friends.
